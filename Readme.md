This project has stripped files out of weka for using weka in android. The weka version used is 3.8.1 (http://www.cs.waikato.ac.nz/ml/weka/downloading.html).

If you want to directly use the weka for android, download the weka snaphot jar in dist folder of this project.

Please make note, the jar may not support all functionalities of weka.

To use it in Android, copy the jar file to libs folder of your android app directory, through windows explorer or mac finder. Then open Project files view in android on the left side of android studio, find the libs folder, right click the weka.jar file, and select add as library. Now you are ready to compile and use weka in android apps.
